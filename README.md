üîñ Overview

Food is all around us and a driving force for most people to be productive. But then there are sumptuous delicacies - food that some may want to try - if not just once in their life. Some are expensive; some are only available at a specific place. Nonetheless, food is omnipresent in the web world, from restaurants' online ordering systems to just a simple menu, recipe sites, or maybe a single blog post of someone's favorite dish. (We all know everyone should be eating pizza with pineapples on top every day.)

For those looking for a more functional submission, focus on a UI that one can use to order food or maybe build a pizza/burger builder like your favorite chain. For someone with a creative mind, try representing a dish that you couldn't live without. The possibilities are endless: that is precisely what WebJam tries to bring to the table (get it?).
